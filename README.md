# school_management_system
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

The title of the project is “School Management system”. This project will handle whole the activities of the school. School management has most of the facilities that a modern school requires to computerize its day-to-day jobs. It provides facilities to keep the records of students and teachers which are required by the management during normal business operations to operate the business effectively

<h3>CONCEPTS USED</h3>


	<b>Class</b>: The building block of C++ that leads to Object Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.
o	Classes in the program are staff, teacher and student.
o	An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

	<b>Data Abstraction</b>: The process of identifying and separating essential features without including the internal details is abstraction. Only the essential information is provided to the outside world while the background details are hidden. 

	<b>Data encapsulation</b>: It is combining of data and the functions associated with it.

	<b>Inheritance</b>: inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. Inheritance provides re-usability. This means that we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it.
o	Type of inheritance used in the program is hierarchical inheritance where multiple derived classes have the same base class.
o	In this program, class student and teacher are inheriting from class staff.
